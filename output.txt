   Abstract
   Background: Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe is one of the most prevalent
   diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other small grain cereals. Resistance against the fungus is quantitative
   and more than 100 quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been described. Two well-validated and highly reproducible QTL,
   Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A have been widely investigated, but to date the underlying genes have not been identified.
   Results: We have investigated a gene co-expression network activated in response to F. graminearum using RNA-seq
   data from near-isogenic lines, harboring either the resistant or the susceptible allele for Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. The
   network identified pathogen-responsive modules, which were enriched for differentially expressed genes between
   genotypes or different time points after inoculation with the pathogen. Central gene analysis identified transcripts
   associated with either QTL within the network. Moreover, we present a detailed gene expression analysis of four gene
   families (glucanases, NBS-LRR, WRKY transcription factors and UDP-glycosyltransferases), which take prominent roles in
   the pathogen response.
   Conclusions: A combination of a network-driven approach and differential gene expression analysis identified genes
   and pathways associated with Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. We find G-protein coupled receptor kinases and biosynthesis genes
   for jasmonate and ethylene earlier induced for Fhb1. Similarly, we find genes involved in the biosynthesis and
   metabolism of riboflavin more abundant for Qfhs.ifa-5A.
