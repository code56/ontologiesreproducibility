     Abstract
     The disease septoria leaf blotch of wheat, caused by fungal pathogen Septoria tritici, is of worldwide concern. The
     fungus exhibits a hemibiotrophic lifestyle, with a long symptomless, biotrophic phase followed by a sudden transition
     to necrotrophy associated with host necrosis. Little is known about the systematic interaction between fungal
     pathogenicity and host responses at specific growth stages and the factors triggering the transition. In order to gain
     some insights into global transcriptome alterations in both host and pathogen during the two phases of the
     compatible interaction, disease transition was monitored using pathogenesis-related gene markers and H2O2
     signature prior to RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the slow symptomless growth was accompanied by
     minor metabolic responses and slightly suppressed defences in the host, whereas necrotrophic growth was
     associated with enhanced host responses involving energy metabolism, transport, signalling, defence and oxidative
     stress as well as a decrease in photosynthesis. The fungus expresses distinct classes of stage-specific genes
     encoding potential effectors, probably first suppressing plant defence responses/facilitating the symptomless growth
     and later triggering life style transition and inducing host necrosis/facilitating the necrotrophic growth. Transport,
     signalling, anti-oxidative stress mechanisms and apoplastic nutrient acquisition play important roles in the entire
     infection process of S. tritici. Our findings uncover systematic S. tritici-induced expression profiles of wheat related to
     specific fungal infection strategies and provide a transcriptome resource for studying both hosts and pathogens in
     plant-Dothideomycete interactions.
