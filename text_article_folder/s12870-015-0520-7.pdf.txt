  Abstract
  Background: The gibberellin (GA) pathway plays a central role in the regulation of plant development, with the
  2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs: GA20ox, GA3ox, GA2ox) that catalyse the later steps in the biosynthetic
  pathway of particularly importance in regulating bioactive GA levels. Although GA has important impacts on crop yield
  and quality, our understanding of the regulation of GA biosynthesis during wheat and barley development remains
  limited. In this study we identified or assembled genes encoding the GA 2-ODDs of wheat, barley and Brachypodium
  distachyon and characterised the wheat genes by heterologous expression and transcript analysis.
  Results: The wheat, barley and Brachypodium genomes each contain orthologous copies of the GA20ox, GA3ox and
  GA2ox genes identified in rice, with the exception of OsGA3ox1 and OsGA2ox5 which are absent in these species. Some
  additional paralogs of 2-ODD genes were identified: notably, a novel gene in the wheat B genome related to GA3ox2
  was shown to encode a GA 1-oxidase, named as TaGA1ox-B1. This enzyme is likely to be responsible for the abundant
  1β-hydroxylated GAs present in developing wheat grains. We also identified a related gene in barley, located in a syntenic
  position to TaGA1ox-B1, that encodes a GA 3,18-dihydroxylase which similarly accounts for the accumulation of unusual
  GAs in barley grains. Transcript analysis showed that some paralogs of the different classes of 2-ODD were expressed
  mainly in a single tissue or at specific developmental stages. In particular, TaGA20ox3, TaGA1ox1, TaGA3ox3 and TaGA2ox7
  were predominantly expressed in developing grain. More detailed analysis of grain-specific gene expression showed
  that while the transcripts of biosynthetic genes were most abundant in the endosperm, genes encoding inactivation
  and signalling components were more highly expressed in the seed coat and pericarp.
  Conclusions: The comprehensive expression and functional characterisation of the multigene families encoding the 2-ODD
  enzymes of the GA pathway in wheat and barley will provide the basis for a better understanding of GA-regulated
  development in these species. This analysis revealed the existence of a novel, endosperm-specific GA 1-oxidase in
  wheat and a related GA 3,18-dihydroxylase enzyme in barley that may play important roles during grain expansion
  and development.

cum aestivum L.), semi-dwarfing alleles of the Rht
DELLA genes were key to increasing yield during the
Green Revolution as not only did the shorter stature

rates, but also enhanced harvest index by reducing straw
biomass and, in many genetic backgrounds, increasing
grain numbers per ear [15]. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a
similar height phenotype was conferred by loss-of-
function mutations in a key GA biosynthetic gene,
OsGA20ox2 [16], and there is evidence that semi-
dwarfing of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by the sdw1/
denso gene is associated with reduced expression of the
orthologous HvGA20ox2 gene [17].
   Although Rht semi-dwarfing alleles are widespread in
modern wheat varieties, the involvement of Rht in all
GA responses results in pleiotropic effects on many
other traits. For example, even mild alleles such as Rht-
B1b and Rht-D1b impart reduced leaf area [18]. These
alleles also have a strong effect on coleoptile elongation
which prevents deeper sowing under dry conditions [19].
Better targeting of the dwarfing effect to stem tissues
might therefore confer significant advantages. In contrast
to Rht, the enzymes acting during the latter stages of GA
biosynthesis are encoded by multiple paralogs with over-      Figure 1 Principal reactions of the GA biosynthetic pathway in plants.
