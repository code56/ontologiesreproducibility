may contribute to increased pathogen endurance. Mapping to the highly resolved region of Fhb1 reduced the
list of candidates to few genes that are speciﬁcally expressed in presence of the quantitative trait loci and in
response to the pathogen, which include a receptor-like protein kinase, a protein kinase, and an E3 ubiquitin-
protein ligase. On a genome-scale level, the individual subgenomes of hexaploid wheat contribute differentially
to defense. In particular, the D subgenome exhibited a pronounced response to the pathogen and contributed
signiﬁcantly to the overall defense response.
