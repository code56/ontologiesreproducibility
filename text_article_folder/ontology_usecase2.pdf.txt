  Abstract
  Background: Increasing the nutrient concentration of wheat grains is important to ameliorate nutritional deficiencies
  in many parts of the world. Proteins and nutrients in the wheat grain are largely derived from the remobilization of
  degraded leaf molecules during monocarpic senescence. The down-regulation of the NAC transcription factor Grain
  Protein Content (GPC) in transgenic wheat plants delays senescence (>3 weeks) and reduces the concentration of
  protein, Zn and Fe in the grain (>30%), linking senescence and nutrient remobilization.
  Based on the early and rapid up-regulation of GPC in wheat flag leaves after anthesis, we hypothesized that this
  transcription factor is an early regulator of monocarpic senescence. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput
  mRNA-seq technologies to characterize the effect of the GPC down-regulation on the wheat flag-leaf transcriptome 12
  days after anthesis. At this early stage of senescence GPC transcript levels are significantly lower in transgenic GPC-RNAi
  plants than in the wild type, but there are still no visible phenotypic differences between genotypes.
  Results: We generated 1.4 million 454 reads from early senescing flag leaves (average ~350 nt) and assembled 1.2
  million into 30,497 contigs that were used as a reference to map 145 million Illumina reads from three wild type
  and four GPC-RNAi plants. Following normalization and statistical testing, we identified a set of 691 genes
  differentially regulated by GPC (431 ≥ 2-fold change). Transcript level ratios between transgenic and wild type
  plants showed a high correlation (R = 0.83) between qRT-PCR and Illumina results, providing independent
  validation of the mRNA-seq approach. A set of differentially expressed genes were analyzed across an early
  senescence time-course.
  Conclusions: Monocarpic senescence is an active process characterized by large-scale changes in gene expression
  which begins considerably before the appearance of visual symptoms of senescence. The mRNA-seq approach
  used here was able to detect small differences in transcript levels during the early stages of senescence. This
  resulted in an extensive list of GPC-regulated genes, which includes transporters, hormone regulated genes, and
  transcription factors. These GPC-regulated genes, particularly those up-regulated during senescence, provide
  valuable entry points to dissect the early stages of monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization in wheat.

approximately 35% at 12 days after anthesis (DAA) and
by 67% at 22 DAA, relative to the wild type (WT) non-
transgenic sister lines (Figure 1D). Senescence in GPC-
RNAi plants was delayed by approximately three weeks,
as previously reported [3]. To investigate the effect of

studies on RNA samples collected from flag leaves at12
DAA, when GPC transcript levels are approximately one
third of their level at the transcriptional peak [3]. At
this time point, GPC-RNAi transgenic plants showed
significantly lower levels of GPC transcripts than the
WT controls, but neither genotype showed visual symp-
toms of senescence (e.g. yellowing of the peduncle and a
loss of chlorophyll from the leaves, Figure 1A-B, [3]).
‘Bobwhite’ (the variety used to produce the transgenic
plants) frequently shows leaf tip necrosis, but this was
observed with equal frequency in both genotypes and
was unrelated to the onset of terminal senescence. Even
at 22 DAA, when additional samples were collected for
qRT-PCR time course studies, there were still no visible
signs of senescence in either genotype (Additional file 1
figure S1).
   Since no wheat senescence transcriptome was avail-
able to use as a reference, we generated a de novo tran-
scriptome assembly from flag leaves 12 days after
anthesis using the 454 sequencing platform. This tech-
nology generates longer transcripts than Illumina, facili-
tating de novo assembly [31]. We sequenced four
biological replicates per genotype using two 454 runs
(two wild type and two GPC-RNAi transgenic plants per
run) and produced 1,469,817 reads, with a median
sequence length of 415 nucleotides (Additional file 1 fig-
ure S2A). The numbers of reads per plant are described
in Additional file 1 table S1).
   Eighty percent of the reads (1,179,902) were assembled
into 30,696 contigs with a median length of 934 nucleo-

  Figure 5 Transcript levels of selected isogroups across a senescence leaf time course. Expression levels in WT and GPC-RNAi plants were
  determined using qRT-PCR at four points across a senescing leaf time course (H = heading, D = days after anthesis). Transcript levels are
  presented as normalized linearized values using the 2-ΔΔCt method [36], where Ct is the threshold cycle. Values are corrected using the same
