Nascent allohexaploid wheat may represent the initial genetic state of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), which arose as a hybrid
between Triticum turgidum (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD) and by chromosome doubling and outcompeted its parents in
growth vigor and adaptability. To better understand the molecular basis for this success, we performed mRNA and small RNA
transcriptome analyses in nascent allohexaploid wheat and its following generations, their progenitors, and the natural
allohexaploid cultivar Chinese Spring, with the assistance of recently published A and D genome sequences. We found that
nonadditively expressed protein-coding genes were rare but relevant to growth vigor. Moreover, a high proportion of protein-
coding genes exhibited parental expression level dominance, with genes for which the total homoeolog expression level in the
progeny was similar to that in T. turgidum potentially participating in development and those with similar expression to that in Ae.
tauschii involved in adaptation. In addition, a high proportion of microRNAs showed nonadditive expression upon polyploidization,
potentially leading to differential expression of important target genes. Furthermore, increased small interfering RNA density was
observed for transposable element–associated D homoeologs in the allohexaploid progeny, which may account for biased
repression of D homoeologs. Together, our data provide insights into small RNA–mediated dynamic homoeolog regulation
mechanisms that may contribute to heterosis in nascent hexaploid wheat.
