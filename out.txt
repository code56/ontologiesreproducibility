Resistance against the fungus is quantitative\n   and more than 100 quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been described. Two well-validated and highly reproducible QTL,\n   Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A have been widely investigated, but to date the underlying genes have not been identified.\n   Results: We have investigated a gene co-expression network activated in response to F. graminearum using RNA-seq\n   data from near-isogenic lines, harboring either the resistant or the susceptible allele for Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. The\n   network identified pathogen-responsive modules, which were enriched for differentially expressed genes between\n   genotypes or different time points after inoculation with the pathogen. Central gene analysis identified transcripts\n   associated with either QTL within the network. Moreover, we present a detailed gene expression analysis of four gene\n   families (glucanases, NBS-LRR, WRKY transcription factors and UDP-glycosyltransferases), which take prominent roles in\n   the pathogen response.\n   Conclusions: A combination of a network-driven approach and differential gene expression analysis identified genes\n   and pathways associated with Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. We find G-protein coupled receptor kinases and biosynthesis genes\n   for jasmonate and ethylene earlier induced for Fhb1. Similarly, we find genes involved in the biosynthesis and\n   metabolism of riboflavin more abundant for Qfhs.ifa-5A.\n   Keywords: Triticum aestivum, Bread wheat, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium head blight, Fhb1, Qfhs.ifa-5A,\n   Transcriptome, Gene co-expression network, RNA-seq\nBackground                                                                                 world.

Proteins and nutrients in the wheat grain are largely derived from the remobilization of\n  degraded leaf molecules during monocarpic senescence. The down-regulation of the NAC transcription factor Grain\n  Protein Content (GPC) in transgenic wheat plants delays senescence (>3 weeks) and reduces the concentration of\n  protein, Zn and Fe in the grain (>30%), linking senescence and nutrient remobilization.\n  Based on the early and rapid up-regulation of GPC in wheat flag leaves after anthesis, we hypothesized that this\n  transcription factor is an early regulator of monocarpic senescence. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput\n  mRNA-seq technologies to characterize the effect of the GPC down-regulation on the wheat flag-leaf transcriptome 12\n  days after anthesis. At this early stage of senescence GPC transcript levels are significantly lower in transgenic GPC-RNAi\n  plants than in the wild type, but there are still no visible phenotypic differences between genotypes.\n  Results: We generated 1.4 million 454 reads from early senescing flag leaves (average ~350 nt) and assembled 1.2\n  million into 30,497 contigs that were used as a reference to map 145 million Illumina reads from three wild type\n  and four GPC-RNAi plants. Following normalization and statistical testing, we identified a set of 691 genes\n  differentially regulated by GPC (431 ≥ 2-fold change). Transcript level ratios between transgenic and wild type\n  plants showed a high correlation (R = 0.83) between qRT-PCR and Illumina results, providing independent\n  validation of the mRNA-seq approach. A set of differentially expressed genes were analyzed across an early\n  senescence time-course.\n  Conclusions: Monocarpic senescence is an active process characterized by large-scale changes in gene expression\n  which begins considerably before the appearance of visual symptoms of senescence. The mRNA-seq approach\n  used here was able to detect small differences in transcript levels during the early stages of senescence. This\n  resulted in an extensive list of GPC-regulated genes, which includes transporters, hormone regulated genes, and\n  transcription factors. These GPC-regulated genes, particularly those up-regulated during senescence, provide\n  valuable entry points to dissect the early stages of monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization in wheat.\nBackground                                                                               therefore, increases in the nutritional quality of the\nWheat provides approximately one fifth of the calories                                   wheat grain are possible and have the potential to allevi-\nin the human diet and is an important source of vegeta-                                  ate nutrient deficiencies.

Senescence in GPC-\nRNAi plants was delayed by approximately three weeks,\nas previously reported [3]. To investigate the effect of\nthe down-regulation of the GPC transcription factors on\nthe early stages of senescence, we focused our 454 de\nnovo transcriptome assembly and Illumina expression\nstudies on RNA samples collected from flag leaves at12\nDAA, when GPC transcript levels are approximately one\nthird of their level at the transcriptional peak [3]. At\nthis time point, GPC-RNAi transgenic plants showed\nsignificantly lower levels of GPC transcripts than the\nWT controls, but neither genotype showed visual symp-\ntoms of senescence (e.g. yellowing of the peduncle and a\nloss of chlorophyll from the leaves, Figure 1A-B, [3]).\n‘Bobwhite’ (the variety used to produce the transgenic\nplants) frequently shows leaf tip necrosis, but this was\nobserved with equal frequency in both genotypes and\nwas unrelated to the onset of terminal senescence. Even\nat 22 DAA, when additional samples were collected for\nqRT-PCR time course studies, there were still no visible\nsigns of senescence in either genotype (Additional file 1\nfigure S1).\n   Since no wheat senescence transcriptome was avail-\nable to use as a reference, we generated a de novo tran-\nscriptome assembly from flag leaves 12 days after\nanthesis using the 454 sequencing platform. This tech-\nnology generates longer transcripts than Illumina, facili-\ntating de novo assembly [31]. We sequenced four\nbiological replicates per genotype using two 454 runs\n(two wild type and two GPC-RNAi transgenic plants per\nrun) and produced 1,469,817 reads, with a median\nsequence length of 415 nucleotides (Additional file 1 fig-\nure S2A). The numbers of reads per plant are described\nin Additional file 1 table S1).\n   Eighty percent of the reads (1,179,902) were assembled\ninto 30,696 contigs with a median length of 934 nucleo-\ntides (Additional file 1 figure S2B).

Resistance against the fungus is quantitative\n   and more than 100 quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been described. Two well-validated and highly reproducible QTL,\n   Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A have been widely investigated, but to date the underlying genes have not been identified.\n   Results: We have investigated a gene co-expression network activated in response to F. graminearum using RNA-seq\n   data from near-isogenic lines, harboring either the resistant or the susceptible allele for Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. The\n   network identified pathogen-responsive modules, which were enriched for differentially expressed genes between\n   genotypes or different time points after inoculation with the pathogen. Central gene analysis identified transcripts\n   associated with either QTL within the network. Moreover, we present a detailed gene expression analysis of four gene\n   families (glucanases, NBS-LRR, WRKY transcription factors and UDP-glycosyltransferases), which take prominent roles in\n   the pathogen response.\n   Conclusions: A combination of a network-driven approach and differential gene expression analysis identified genes\n   and pathways associated with Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. We find G-protein coupled receptor kinases and biosynthesis genes\n   for jasmonate and ethylene earlier induced for Fhb1. Similarly, we find genes involved in the biosynthesis and\n   metabolism of riboflavin more abundant for Qfhs.ifa-5A.\n   Keywords: Triticum aestivum, Bread wheat, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium head blight, Fhb1, Qfhs.ifa-5A,\n   Transcriptome, Gene co-expression network, RNA-seq\nBackground                                                                                 world.

Proteins and nutrients in the wheat grain are largely derived from the remobilization of\n  degraded leaf molecules during monocarpic senescence. The down-regulation of the NAC transcription factor Grain\n  Protein Content (GPC) in transgenic wheat plants delays senescence (>3 weeks) and reduces the concentration of\n  protein, Zn and Fe in the grain (>30%), linking senescence and nutrient remobilization.\n  Based on the early and rapid up-regulation of GPC in wheat flag leaves after anthesis, we hypothesized that this\n  transcription factor is an early regulator of monocarpic senescence. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput\n  mRNA-seq technologies to characterize the effect of the GPC down-regulation on the wheat flag-leaf transcriptome 12\n  days after anthesis. At this early stage of senescence GPC transcript levels are significantly lower in transgenic GPC-RNAi\n  plants than in the wild type, but there are still no visible phenotypic differences between genotypes.\n  Results: We generated 1.4 million 454 reads from early senescing flag leaves (average ~350 nt) and assembled 1.2\n  million into 30,497 contigs that were used as a reference to map 145 million Illumina reads from three wild type\n  and four GPC-RNAi plants. Following normalization and statistical testing, we identified a set of 691 genes\n  differentially regulated by GPC (431 ≥ 2-fold change). Transcript level ratios between transgenic and wild type\n  plants showed a high correlation (R = 0.83) between qRT-PCR and Illumina results, providing independent\n  validation of the mRNA-seq approach. A set of differentially expressed genes were analyzed across an early\n  senescence time-course.\n  Conclusions: Monocarpic senescence is an active process characterized by large-scale changes in gene expression\n  which begins considerably before the appearance of visual symptoms of senescence. The mRNA-seq approach\n  used here was able to detect small differences in transcript levels during the early stages of senescence. This\n  resulted in an extensive list of GPC-regulated genes, which includes transporters, hormone regulated genes, and\n  transcription factors. These GPC-regulated genes, particularly those up-regulated during senescence, provide\n  valuable entry points to dissect the early stages of monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization in wheat.\nBackground                                                                               therefore, increases in the nutritional quality of the\nWheat provides approximately one fifth of the calories                                   wheat grain are possible and have the potential to allevi-\nin the human diet and is an important source of vegeta-                                  ate nutrient deficiencies.

Senescence in GPC-\nRNAi plants was delayed by approximately three weeks,\nas previously reported [3]. To investigate the effect of\nthe down-regulation of the GPC transcription factors on\nthe early stages of senescence, we focused our 454 de\nnovo transcriptome assembly and Illumina expression\nstudies on RNA samples collected from flag leaves at12\nDAA, when GPC transcript levels are approximately one\nthird of their level at the transcriptional peak [3]. At\nthis time point, GPC-RNAi transgenic plants showed\nsignificantly lower levels of GPC transcripts than the\nWT controls, but neither genotype showed visual symp-\ntoms of senescence (e.g. yellowing of the peduncle and a\nloss of chlorophyll from the leaves, Figure 1A-B, [3]).\n‘Bobwhite’ (the variety used to produce the transgenic\nplants) frequently shows leaf tip necrosis, but this was\nobserved with equal frequency in both genotypes and\nwas unrelated to the onset of terminal senescence. Even\nat 22 DAA, when additional samples were collected for\nqRT-PCR time course studies, there were still no visible\nsigns of senescence in either genotype (Additional file 1\nfigure S1).\n   Since no wheat senescence transcriptome was avail-\nable to use as a reference, we generated a de novo tran-\nscriptome assembly from flag leaves 12 days after\nanthesis using the 454 sequencing platform. This tech-\nnology generates longer transcripts than Illumina, facili-\ntating de novo assembly [31]. We sequenced four\nbiological replicates per genotype using two 454 runs\n(two wild type and two GPC-RNAi transgenic plants per\nrun) and produced 1,469,817 reads, with a median\nsequence length of 415 nucleotides (Additional file 1 fig-\nure S2A).
