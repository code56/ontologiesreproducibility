# Ontologies and Reproducibility

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to use machine learning models and ontologies to improve the reproducibility of scientific research.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- owlready2

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn owlready2


## Usage

To use this code, you can simply run the main.py file (i.e. Deus_ex_machina.py). This file takes as input a CSV file containing data that has been annotated with ontologies, and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the data. The output is a new CSV file containing the classified data.
