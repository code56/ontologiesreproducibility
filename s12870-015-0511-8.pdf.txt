  Abstract
  Background: Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a globally important crop. Heat, drought and their
  combination dramatically reduce wheat yield and quality, but the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat
  tolerance to extreme environments, especially stress combination, are largely unknown. As an allohexaploid, wheat
  consists of three closely related subgenomes (A, B, and D), and was reported to show improved tolerance to stress
  conditions compared to tetraploid. But so far very little is known about how wheat coordinates the expression of
  homeologous genes to cope with various environmental constraints on the whole-genome level.
  Results: To explore the transcriptional response of wheat to the individual and combined stress, we performed
  high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of seedlings under normal condition and subjected to drought stress
  (DS), heat stress (HS) and their combination (HD) for 1 h and 6 h, and presented global gene expression reprograms
  in response to these three stresses. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DS, HS and HD responsive genes
  revealed an overlap and complexity of functional pathways between each other. Moreover, 4,375 wheat transcription
  factors were identified on a whole-genome scale based on the released scaffold information by IWGSC, and 1,328 were
  responsive to stress treatments. Then, the regulatory network analysis of HSFs and DREBs implicated they were both
  involved in the regulation of DS, HS and HD response and indicated a cross-talk between heat and drought stress.
  Finally, approximately 68.4 % of homeologous genes were found to exhibit expression partitioning in response to DS,
  HS or HD, which was further confirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR and Nullisomic-Tetrasomic lines.
  Conclusions: A large proportion of wheat homeologs exhibited expression partitioning under normal and abiotic
  stresses, which possibly contributes to the wide adaptability and distribution of hexaploid wheat in response to various
  environmental constraints.
