  Abstract
  Background: Wheat yellow (stripe) rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST) is one of the most
  devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. To design effective breeding strategies that maximize the potential for
  durable disease resistance it is important to understand the molecular basis of PST pathogenicity. In particular, the
  characterisation of the structure, function and evolutionary dynamics of secreted effector proteins that are detected
  by host immune receptors can help guide and prioritize breeding efforts. However, to date, our knowledge of the
  effector repertoire of cereal rust pathogens is limited.
  Results: We re-sequenced genomes of four PST isolates from the US and UK to identify effector candidates and
  relate them to their distinct virulence profiles. First, we assessed SNP frequencies between all isolates, with
  heterokaryotic SNPs being over tenfold more frequent (5.29 ± 2.23 SNPs/kb) than homokaryotic SNPs (0.41 ± 0.28
  SNPs/kb). Next, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline to integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and
  effector-focused annotations to identify and classify effector candidates in PST. RNAseq analysis highlighted
  transcripts encoding secreted proteins that were significantly enriched in haustoria compared to infected tissue.
  The expression of 22 candidate effector genes was characterised using qRT-PCR, revealing distinct temporal
  expression patterns during infection in wheat. Lastly, we identified proteins that displayed non-synonymous
  substitutions specifically between the two UK isolates PST-87/7 and PST-08/21, which differ in virulence to two
  wheat varieties. By focusing on polymorphic variants enriched in haustoria, we identified five polymorphic effector
  candidates between PST-87/7 and PST-08/21 among 2,999 secreted proteins. These allelic variants are now a
  priority for functional validation as virulence/avirulence effectors in the corresponding wheat varieties.
  Conclusions: Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and effector-directed annotation of PST isolates has enabled
  us to move beyond the single isolate-directed catalogues of effector proteins and develop a framework for mining
  effector proteins in closely related isolates and relate these back to their defined virulence profiles. This should
  ultimately lead to more comprehensive understanding of the PST pathogenesis system, an important first step
  towards developing more effective surveillance and management strategies for one of the most devastating
  pathogens of wheat.
