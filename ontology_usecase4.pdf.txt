                                 seeds [10,12,13]. Among the natural mechanisms that have been used for wheat hybrid
                                 breeding, the most desirable system in practice combines the cytoplasmic male sterility
                                 (cms) of the female parent with the fertility-restoring genes (dominant Rf alleles) of the
                                 male parent [10,14]. The cytoplasm of Triticum timopheevii is the most frequently used
                                 cytoplasm for sterilizing wheat [14,15] because it induces male sterility without affecting
                                 female fertility and it has relatively few deleterious effects [16]. This cms system, which
                                 may be the most effective, has serious limitations that are mainly associated with an
                                 extremely low frequency of Rf alleles and the substantial complexity of the fertility restora-
                                 tion, which requires two or three of the nine identified major restorer loci [14,17]. Other
                                 reported limiting factors of the T. timopheevii cms system include the instability of male
                                 sterility [18–20] and the strict requirements for temperature and day-length [21,22].
                                       Most Rf genes encode pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, but there are a few
                                 exceptions, including the rice Rf2 and Rf17 genes, respectively, encoding a mitochondrial
                                 glycine-rich protein [23] and a 178-amino acid mitochondrial sorting protein containing an
                                 acyl-carrier protein synthase-like domain [24] or the maize Rf2 (Rf2a) gene encoding the
                                 aldehyde dehydrogenase domain (ADD) [25,26]. The RF proteins prevent the accumulation
                                 of products encoded by mitochondrial cms-conferring open reading frames [27,28].
                                       To date, eight fertility restorer genes (Rf1–Rf6 and Rf8–Rf9) that restore the production
                                 of normal pollen in wheat with the T. timopheevii sterilizing cytoplasm have been identified
                                 and mapped on the following seven wheat chromosomes: 1A (Rf1), 1BS (Rf3), 2DS (Rf8),
                                 6A (Rf6), 6AS (Rf9), 6B (Rf6 and Rf4), 6D (Rf5), 7B (Rf7), and 7D (Rf2) [29–39]. There is
                                 some uncertainty regarding the nomenclature of Rf2, Rf3, Rf4, and Rf6 [40]. Moreover,
                                 the location of Rf6 remains undetermined, with some researchers indicating this gene
                                 is on chromosomes 6A and 6B (e.g., [37,38]), whereas others have stated this gene is on
                                 chromosome 5D (e.g., [41,42]).
                                       Most Rf genes were characterized in terms of the strength of their effect, and some in-
                                 teractions between these genes have been reported. The Rf3 gene, which was first identified
                                 on chromosome 1B of European spelt [31], is one of the most effective genes for restor-
                                 ing male fertility in common wheat [40,43]. The donors of dominant Rf3 alleles include
                                 wheat cultivar Primépi, which also contains Rf6 [41], and the spelt cultivars Badenkrone,
                                 Badenstern, and Schwabenspelz [31,40,43]. The Rf3 gene was reported as dominant, but it
                                 is suppressed by a weak fertility suppressor gene on chromosome 7D [31,39,43].
                                       Both Rf1 and Rf4 were described as major, codominant restorer genes [30,33,43] af-
                                 fected by several recessive modifiers influenced by the environment [44,45]. Geyer et al. [46]
                                 determined that Rf1 is more highly expressed than Rf4 and that the effects of these loci
                                 are not additive. The Rf2 and Rf5 genes were considered to be minor restorer genes [33].
                                 The major restorer gene Rf6 was transferred to wheat from chromosome 6U of Aegilops
                                 umbellulata Zhuk. [35]. As described above, its location in the wheat genome is unknown.
                                       The dominance of Rf8 localized on chromosome 2DS was verified by Sinha et al. [36].
                                 Another major dominant restorer gene, Rf9, was detected in the subtelomeric region of
                                 chromosome 6AS [39]. Melonek et al. [47] recently identified Rf1 and Rf3 via genetic
                                 mapping, comparative sequence analyses, and functional studies. The proteins encoded
                                 by these two genes bind to the mitochondrial orf279 transcript of a newly identified
                                 mitochondrial gene and induce its cleavage, thereby blocking the expression of the cms
                                 trait. They observed that Rf1 and Rf3 have no effect on another mitochondrial gene,
                                 orf256, previously considered to cause male sterility in wheat. Two other rye-derived
                                 genes restoring male fertility, Rfc3 (on 6RL) and Rfc4 (on 4RL), were detected in wheat–rye
                                 addition lines [48]. These restorer genes, particularly Rfc3, may be useful for hybrid wheat
                                 and triticale breeding programs.
                                       Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for general fertility restoration were also mapped
                                 on wheat chromosomes 1AS, 1BS, 2DS, 4BS, 6AS, 6BS, 7AL, and 7D at positions overlapping
                                 Rf genes [39,46,49–52]. Additionally, several fertility-related QTLs were localized to regions
                                 that were not reported to carry Rf genes (i.e., 1DS, 2AL, 2BS, 4AL, 4BS, 5A, 5BL, and
                                 7AL) [39,49,50,52].

                                        Other than fertility restorer genes effective against G-type cytoplasm, one dominant
                                 restorer gene, Rfv1, and several QTLs effective against Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm (Sv -type)
                                 were identified on the short arm of chromosome 1B [49,53,54]. The mapped position of
                                 Rfv1 is very close (2 cM) to Rf3 [55]. Four other genes, Rfm1 [56], Rfn1 [57], Rfk1 [58],
                                 and Rfu1 [59], encode fertility restorers effective against the cytoplasm of Aegilops mutica
                                 (T-type), Aegilops uniaristata (N-type, previously designated as Mu ), Ae. kotschyi, and Ae.
                                 umbellulata, respectively. All of these genes are localized on chromosome 1B, but the first
                                 three genes are on the short arm. Tsunewaki [60] detected three genes (Rfv1, Rfm1, and
                                 Rfn1) in the same 2.9-cM subsegment bordered by the S-6 and Xucr-5 markers on the 1BS
                                 arm in Pavon and nine other examined wheat cultivars. The locus was named Rf -multi
                                 (i.e., restoration of fertility in multiple CMS systems). Additionally, a major restorer
                                 gene (Rfd1) effective against Aegilops crassa cytoplasm was identified on the long arm of
                                 chromosome 7B [61].
                                        Because of the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, struc-
                                 tural data obtained from chromosome engineering and genetic mapping approaches can
                                 now be coupled with functional characteristics for gene discovery. Transcriptome sequenc-
                                 ing (RNA-seq) is a powerful and cost-efficient tool for studying transcriptomes. It has been
                                 widely used to investigate model and non-model organisms to identify and quantify RNA,
                                 profile transcripts, detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identify genes
                                 differentially expressed between samples [62].
                                        The objective of this study was to identify and characterize Rf candidate genes in two
                                 fertility-restoring wheat genotypes (Primépi and Patras) compared to the non-restoring
                                 cultivars (Astoria and Grana). The RNA-seq data were first processed generally and then
                                 used to specifically identify Rf candidate genes and their paralogs (PAGs) and analyze
                                 gene expression profiles during pollen development.

                                 2.1.1. General Characteristics of the RNA-Seq Data
                                        The sequencing of 24 libraries resulted in 861.3 million raw reads, which included
                                 860.5 million high-quality clean reads. The number of clean reads across the 24 RNA-seq
                                 libraries ranged from 29.4 to 44.3 million. The transcriptomes of fertility-restoring and
                                 non-restoring cultivars were compared at the tetrad (T) and at late uninucleate microspore
                                 (M) stages. The number of upregulated and downregulated DEGs varied among the
                                 12 comparisons. The Grana vs. Patras and Patras vs. Primépi transcriptome comparisons
                                 at the M stage resulted in the most upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The fewest up-
                                 regulated and downregulated DEGs were detected in the Grana vs. Primépi transcriptome
                                 comparison at the M stage (Table 1).
                                        A total of 36,912 DEGs were identified between the transcriptomes of the two fertility-
                                 restoring cultivars and the two non-fertility-restoring cultivars at two anther developmental
                                 stages. In this pool, 20,368 DEGs were not redundant, and 9173 (45%) were unique to
                                 comparisons C1–C12 (Table 1). At the T stage, 2842, 2329, 243, and 19 DEGs were common
                                 to two, three, four, and five comparisons, respectively. This analysis revealed 14 unique
                                 DEGs that distinguished Primépi from the non-fertility-restoring cultivars. Similarly,
                                 126 unique DEGs were useful for distinguishing Patras from the non-fertility-restoring
                                 cultivars at the T stage (Figure 1a).

                                          At the M stage, 3420, 2216, 119, and 5 DEGs were common to two, three, four, and
                                    five comparisons, respectively. Two genes (TraesCS7A02G439300 and TraesCS7B02G338200)
                                   were identified as DEGs in all six comparisons. In this developmental stage, a single
                                    DEG was specific to Primépi (C5 and C6), whereas 69 DEGs were specific to Patras
                                    (C7 and C8), implying these genes are useful for distinguishing these cultivars from
                                    the non-fertility-restoring cultivars (Figure 1b). The DEG analysis indicated 769 of the
                                    36,912 DEGs, including Rf candidates, may be useful for distinguishing the fertility-
                                    restorers from the non-fertility-restorers. Moreover, 210 restorer-specific DEGs were identi-
                                    fied in both developmental stages.
                                    2.1.2. Targeted Analysis of RNA-Seq Results
                                          The general analysis detected many genes differentially expressed in the fertility-
                                    restoring cultivars. To identify the genes related to fertility restoration, the local database of
                                    proteins corresponding to Rf genes (Table S1) was compared with the T. aestivum reference
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                                                 5 of 25
                                       genome, which resulted in the selection of 120,744 wheat genes. These genes were narrowed
                                       down to 535 genes with a sequence similarity and sequence coverage exceeding 49%. The
                                       535 genes were compared with the 20,368 non-redundant DEGs identified in comparisons
                                       C1–C12 (Table 1). This enabled the selection of 40 DEGs present in both pools, representing
                                       0.2% of the initial number of DEGs. Finally, an E-value < 0.05 was applied as a criterion for
                                       selecting 21 DEGs to be analyzed in greater detail (Table 2, Table S2). With the exception
                                       of six DEGs (DEG7, DEG8, DEG14, DEG16, DEG17, and DEG19), which were unique to a
                                       specific comparison (most of them were detected in the Astoria vs. Patras comparison at the
                                       T stage), the DEGs were detected in more than one comparison (up to six). The expression
                                       levels of most of the DEGs revealed by multiple comparisons were stably upregulated or
                                       downregulated in the fertility-restoring cultivars. The exceptions were DEG3, DEG4, DEG5,
                                       and DEG15; the expression levels of these DEGs were upregulated or downregulated in
                                       the fertility restorers depending on the comparison.

                                             Each of the finally selected 21 DEGs matched 1–16 reference sequences. Fourteen DEGs

                                 (XP_020153657.1)) and included the consensus PPR motif. All DEGs in this group encoded
                                 proteins with PPR and tetratricopeptide (TPR)-like helical domains and were similar
                                 to RNA-binding proteins belonging to the mitochondrial group I intron splicing factor
                                 CCM1 family (Table 2). These DEGs were localized on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B,
                                 6A, and 6B. Generally comprising one to three exons, the DEGs represented genetically
                                 differentiated groups with three loci with low allelic variation (1–9 alleles), four moderately
                                 variable loci (20–85 alleles), and seven highly variable loci (132–266 alleles). According
                                 to a BLAST search, the remaining seven DEGs (DEG15–DEG21) only matched Z. mays
                                 Rf2 (NP_001105891.1) and encoded the same ADD. These sequences were mapped to
                                 chromosome 6B and the homoeologous group 7 chromosomes; the genes in this group
                                 comprised 7–11 exons. Single splicing variants were reported for the DEGs, with the
                                 exception of TraesCS7B02G116800, which had two splicing variants. The seven DEGs
                                 encoding the ADD were characterized by high allelic variation, with 38–290 alleles (mean
                                 of 211 alleles) (Table 2).
                                       In silico expression patterns of the selected 21 DEGs, which were determined on
                                 the basis of the NGS read counts, revealed the qualitative and quantitative differences in
                                 the expression levels and patterns (Figure 2). The expression pattern of PPR genes was
                                 genotype- and gene-specific. Very low expression levels were found for DEG1, DEG2,
                                 DEG3, DEG7, DEG8, and DEG13 compared to the other genes. Among the DEGs encoding
                                 the PPR domain (DEGs 1–14), eight were clearly overexpressed in the fertility-restoring
                                 cultivar, Patras. The expression levels of two DEGs, DEG9 and DEG14, were higher in
                                 the second fertility-restoring cultivar, Primépi (but only in the T stage for DEG14). The
                                 expression levels of the four remaining DEGs in the PPR family were higher in one or both
                                 non-fertility-restoring cultivars (usually Astoria). The expression levels and patterns of the
                                 DEGs encoding the ADD exhibited greater genotype and developmental stage specificity.
                                 For example, DEG15 and DEG18 were more highly expressed in Patras than in both non-
                                 fertility-restoring cultivars in the T and M stages, respectively. The DEG19 expression level
                                 was higher in Primépi than in Astoria and Grana, but only in the M stage. The remaining
                                 DEGs encoding the ADD were usually overexpressed in the non-fertility-restoring cultivars.
                                 2.2. Analysis of Paralogous Genes
                                       In order to increase the pool of Rf candidate genes, the reference genome was analyzed
                                 to screen for PAGs of the 21 selected DEGs. A total of 1165 PAGs were identified using
                                 the Ensembl Plants database. This set included 21 previously selected DEGs, which were
                                 paralogs of each other. Next, 775 PAGs with a mean expression level in the samples
                                 exceeding 10 were used for the unsigned weighted correlation network analysis, which
                                 revealed 19 clusters M1, M2, . . . , M19 comprising genes with correlated expression patterns
                                 (Figure 3). Among these clusters, only one (M8) comprised 10 PAGs (PAG7 belonged to
                                 the ADD family, whereas the other PAGs belonged to the PPR family) that were expressed
                                 differently in both fertility-restorers than in the two non-fertility restorers in both pollen
                                 developmental stages (Figure 3).

                                           Generally, the expression patterns of individual genes from cluster M8 were similar to
                                      the normalized expression pattern, with expression higher in fertility restorers (Figure 4),
                                      but there were some clear differences. For example, PAG7, PAG8, and PAG9 were more
                                      highly expressed in the non-fertility-restorers than in the fertility restorers.
                                           Most of the PAGs in clusters M9 (10 genes) and M17 (11 genes), which were all from
                                      the PPR family (Table S3), had average expression levels that were higher in the fertility-
                                      restoring cultivar Patras than in the non-fertility-restoring cultivars Astoria and Grana
                                      in both stages. The expression profiles of individual PAGs from these two groups were
                                      mostly consistent with the normalized patterns (although in some cases (e.g., PAG13 or
                                      PAG24), the expression level differences between the restorer and non-restorer cultivars
                                     were not significant). With the exception of PAG20 in cluster M9 as well as PAG23, PAG24,
                                      and PAG27 in cluster M17, all PAGs were more highly expressed in Primépi than in the
                                      other cultivars, including Patras. The largest cluster (M18) comprised 21 genes that were
                                      expressed at higher levels in the restorer cultivars than in Astoria. In this cluster, PAG50
                                     was the same as one of the 21 DEGs selected according to the RNA-seq data (i.e., DEG16)
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                               8 of 25
                                   (Table S3). An analysis of individual PAGs in this group indicated that the expression levels
                                   of most of the PAGs were consistent with the normalized profile. The six exceptions were
                                   PAG32, PAG34, PAG38, PAG44, PAG48, and PAG51, which were more highly expressed in
                                   Astoria than in the other three cultivars. Three other PAGs were expressed at higher levels
                                   in both restorers than in both non-restorers, but only in one developmental stage (PAG40
                                   and PAG52 in the M stage and PAG45 in the T stage). However, if compared only with
                                   Astoria, the expression levels of most PAGs were higher in both fertility-restoring cultivars
                                   in the T and M stages, which is similar to the normalized profile. In cluster M18, three
                                   PAGs (PAG41, PAG44, and PAG50) belonged to the ADD family, whereas the remaining 18
                                   PAGs were members of the PPR family. The expression patterns of individual PAGs from
                                   clusters M9, M17, and M18 are presented in Figure S1.

                                           The expression patterns of the PAGs in the other seven clusters (M3, M5, M6, M7, M10,
                                     M12, and M19) were less specific. The PAGs more highly expressed in Patras than in the
                                     other cultivars in the first stage formed clusters M3, M5, and M7. The PAGs in clusters
                                     M6 and M10 were most highly expressed in Primépi in the T stage, whereas the PAGs in
                                     clusters M12 and M19 were most highly expressed in Primépi in the M stage. Regarding the
                                     remaining clusters (M1, M2, M4, M11, M13, M14, M15, and M16), the average expression
                                     patterns were usually genotype-specific (Figure 3).
                                           Fifty-two PAGs (including PAG50, which was the same as DEG16) from clusters M8,
                                     M9, M17, and M18 were chosen for additional analyses.
                                     2.3. In Silico Analysis of the Promoters of Selected DEGs and PAGs
                                           To better characterize the selected pool of DEGs and PAGs, a bioinformatic analysis of
                                     their promoters was performed. The 2000-nt sequences upstream of the 21 selected DEGs
                                     included 89 cre (Table S4a,b). In addition to the common cre (CAAT-box and TATA-box),
                                     some identified cre were over-represented (i.e., detected more than 50 times, with a mean
                                     frequency exceeding 2.4 per DEG). Among the over-represented cre were those related
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                       10 of 25
                                 to disease resistance and stress responses (e.g., MYB-binding site, MYB-like sequence,
                                 and MYC), plant development, secondary metabolism and signal transduction (MYC-
                                 binding site), signal transduction and hormone responses (CGTCA-motif, TGACG-motif,
                                 and ABRE), light responses (G-box), and those with unknown functions (STRE, WRE3,
                                 and AS-1). The most common cre were the MYBs, with a frequency greater than eight
                                 per 100 nt. Of the 12 rarest cre in the DEG promoters, five (Box III, chs-CMA2a, chs-Unit
                                 1 m1, Pc-CMA2c, and Gap-box) were related to light responses, three (AT-rich element,
                                 AT-rich sequence, and TGA-box) were associated with hormone responses, two (HD-Zip 1
                                 and HD-Zip 3) influenced developmental processes, one (AC-II) was related to vascular
                                 tissue-specific expression, and one (JARE) was not functionally characterized (Table S4a,b).
                                 Three cre (AT-rich sequence, Box II-like sequence, and Box III) were detected only once in
                                 the whole DEG set (Table S4a–c). The most frequent cre (at least seven per 100 nt) were
                                 detected in DEG1, DEG3, and DEG21, whereas the least frequent cre (1.9 per 100 nt) were
                                 detected in DEG7 (Table S4a,b). The mean frequency of the cre in the promoters of DEGs
                                 encoding the PPR domain was almost identical to the mean frequency of the cre in the
                                 promoters of DEGs encoding the ADD (Table S4b).
                                      A similar examination of the 2000-nt sequences upstream of 52 PAGs revealed
                                 103 cre, which was 13 more than the number of cre detected in the DEG promoters. The
                                 13 cre unique to the PAG promoter set were as follows: 3-AF3-binding site, AAAC-motif,
                                 AACA-motif, CAG-motif, chs-CMA2b, F-box, E2Fb, GC-repeat, L-box, motif I, NON, OCT,
                                 and Pc-CMA2a (Table S4a,d,e).
                                      Excluding the common cre (CAAT-box and TATA-box) in the PAG promoters, the
                                 most frequent cre (i.e., detected more than 135 times, with a mean frequency exceeding
                                 2.60 per PAG), were the same as the most frequent cre among the DEGs, with the exception
                                 of WRE3 (unknown function). The frequency of the common MYB cre was only slightly
                                 lower for the PAGs (7.77 per 100 nt) than for the DEGs. Of the 17 least frequent cre, which
                                 were usually detected in only one PAG promoter, six (AAAC motif, chs-CMA2b, L-box,
                                 LS7, Pc-CMA2a, and Pc-CMA2c) were associated with light responses and five were related
                                 to specific processes, including endosperm-specific negative expression (AACA motif),
                                 vascular tissue-specific expression (AC-II), auxin responses (AuxRE), development (HD-
                                 Zip 3), and root-specific gene regulation (motif I). Additionally, the 3-AF3-binding site
                                 was included in a conserved DNA module array. The functions of the remaining five cre
                                 (ACTCATCCT sequence, AT1-motif, CAG-motif, F-box, and OCT) remain unknown. The
                                 PAGs with the highest cre frequencies were PAG12, PAG44, and PAG46, whereas PAG37
                                 was revealed as the PAG with the lowest cre frequency (2.55 per 2000 nt) (Table S4a,d).
                                 Two rarely occurring cre (AuxRE and HD-Zip 3) were detected in the 2000-nt sequences
                                 upstream of the DEGs and PAGs (Table S4a,b,d).
                                      A comparison among the promoters of DEGs, PAGs, and 12 reference genes generally
                                 did not reveal any major common features. Four cre (4cl-CMA1b, H-box, telo-box, and
                                 Y-box) were unique to the reference genes. The most frequent cre were similar in all three
                                 gene groups. Moreover, among the most frequent cre, five (ABRE, CGTCA-motif, TGACG-
                                 motif, STRE, and AS-1; the first three are related to signal transduction pathways) were
                                 common to the reference genes, DEGs, and PAGs. The MYBs occurred less frequently, but
                                 they were still relatively common (5.75 per 100 nt). In terms of the rarest cre, they were
                                 most commonly detected in the reference genes (Table S4a,c,e).
                                 2.4. Mapping DEGs and PAGs in Rf Gene Regions
                                      The next step was the mapping of 21 DEGs identified during the targeted RNA-seq
                                 analysis (Table 2), and the 52 detected PAGs (including PAG 50, which is the same as
                                 DEG16) (Table S5) were mapped on the wheat reference genome (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0)
                                 along with the available genetic markers linked to known fertility restoration genes (Table
                                 S3). Moreover, the physical positions of 1690 PPR domain-encoding genes in the CS genome
                                 (version 1) available in the URGI database (TaPPR genes) and 62 loci encoding proteins
                                 with the ADD (Table S6) were used to saturate regions comprising Rf genes and QTLs.
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                                 11 of 25
                                          The seven physical regions corresponding to Rf gene positions, two additional fertility-
                                    related loci on 1B, and three QTLs mapped highly precisely on 2A, 5B, and 7A were used
                                    to identify co-localized DEGs and PAGs (Figure 5, Figure S2). Five DEGs were localized on
                                    chromosomes 1A and 1B within regions with previously mapped Rf1 and R3 genes. The
                                    remaining 16 DEGs were assigned to regions that did not overlap with reported Rf loci.
                                    Genetic mapping data were sufficient for identifying physical regions corresponding to Rf1
                                    (1A: 5.02–32.9 Mb), Rf3 (1B: 16.85–44.07 Mb), Rf4 (6B: 3.88–35.52 Mb), Rf6 (5D: 371.47–445.11
                                    Mb), Rf8 (2D: 13.75–23.02 Mb), and Rf9 (6A: 0.96–23.72 Mb). An anchor marker (Xgdm130)
                                    for Rf2 was also physically mapped to 7D (4.2 Mb), but there were no genetic markers for
                                    Rf5 and Rf7. A detailed analysis of the markers mapped to chromosome 1B revealed two
                                    major loci related to fertility restoration in addition to Rf3. The first locus (QRf.Sv-1B), which
                                    explained 13.9%–17.6% of the seed set variation, was delimited to the 336.21–363.15 Mb
                                    region. The second region (1B: 506.33–557.12 Mb), which explained 16.8%–38.2% of the
                                    seed set variation, was previously reported as Rf3 (Ahmed et al., 2001, Zhou et al., 2005).
                                    The physical mapping of fertility restoration QTLs resulted in the detection of a region on
                                    2A (705.51–724.30 Mb), which explained 8.3%–21.0% of the seed set variation and minor
                                    loci on 5B (6.65–16.42 cM) and 7A (674.28–674.80 cM). The remaining QTLs were localized
                                    to large physical regions (1D, 2B, and 4A) or were mapped with single markers (4B and 5A).
                                    Partial physical maps revealed the co-localization of DEG1 and DEG5 with the recently
                                    mapped Rf1 and Rf3 genes (Figure 5).

        in Mbp. TaPPR markers refer to annotated PPR genes (URGI). The DEGs and PAGs that were localized within any Rf locus
        are framed.
                                          Of the 52 PAGs, only three (PAG16, PAG17, and PAG34) were physically mapped to
                                    regions affecting fertility. Specifically, PAG34 was mapped to the same region as the QTL
                                    QRf.Sv-1B (336.2–336.4 Mbp). Additionally, PAG17 was mapped to a position (18.8 Mb) in
                                    the Rf4 region delimited to 3.9–35.5 Mbp (Ma and Sorrels, 1995, Geyer et al. 2018). Finally,
                                    PAG16 was mapped to a position (14.36 Mb) in the Rf9 region (5.4–23.7 Mbp) flanked by
                                    the markers IWB33595 and IWB73288 [39]. Both PAGs mapped in the Rf4 and Rf9 regions
                                    were more highly expressed in Patras than in Astoria and Grana in the M stage.

                                 2.5. qRT-PCR Analysis of Selected DEGs and PAGs
                                       To validate the in silico expression data, a quantitative reverse transcription PCR
                                 (qRT-PCR) analysis of 11 DEGs and 11 PAGs, all encoding the PPR domain, was performed.
                                 For 10 DEGs (DEG4, DEG5, and DEG7–DEG14) and 10 PAGs (PAG1, PAG5, PAG10,
                                 PAG15–PAG17, PAG22, PAG23, PAG27, and PAG31), the main selection criterion was the
                                 expected expression profile determined in silico (i.e., DEGs and PAGs that were more
                                 highly expressed in at least one fertility-restoring cultivar than in at least one non-fertility-
                                 restoring cultivar). Both DEG6 and PAG34 were chosen because they were expressed at
                                 much higher levels in the non-fertility-restoring cultivar Astoria. The presence of at least
                                 one cre in the 50 upstream regulatory sequence was an additional criterion.
                                       Regarding the DEGs, in most cases, the gene expression analyses produced relatively
                                 consistent data (Figures 2 and 6). In contrast, the expression levels of two DEGs (DEG9 and
                                 DEG14) differed substantially between the in silico and qRT-PCR analyses. More specif-
                                 ically, according to the in silico analysis, DEG9 and DEG14 were most highly expressed
                                 in Primépi, particularly in the T stage, whereas the qRT-PCR data indicated these genes
                                 were most highly expressed in Patras in the T stage. There were some inconsistencies in the
                                 expression analyses of DEG4, DEG5, and DEG8. The DEG4 and DEG5 expression profiles
                                 were consistent in the M stage. The DEG8 expression pattern determined by qRT-PCR
                                 was consistent with the results of the in silico data in the T stage, but in the M stage, the
                                 qRT-PCR analysis indicated this gene was more highly expressed in Patras only when
                                 compared with the corresponding Grana expression level. The highest consistency between
                                 the qRT-PCR and in silico data was observed for DEG3, which was most highly expressed
                                 in Astoria.
                                       In contrast to the DEGs, the qRT-PCR data for the PAGs were consistent with the in
                                 silico data for only three PAGs (PAG1, PAG10, and PAG31) (Figure 6, Figure S1). The qRT-
                                 PCR expression data for PAG5, PAG15, and PAG34 were partially consistent with the results
                                 of the in silico analysis, especially in the T stage and in the comparison between Patras and
                                 Astoria. However, the expression profiles varied considerably between the two expression
                                 analyses for PAG16, PAG22, PAG23, and PAG27. The biggest discrepancy was observed
                                 for PAG22 and PAG27. The expression profiles of these PAGs in both fertility-restoring
                                 cultivars were the complete opposite in the qRT-PCR and in silico assays.
                                 2.6. Annotation of PPR Genes
                                       To identify the genes most likely responsible for fertility restoration, 14 DEGs and
                                 48 PAGs in the CS reference genome that were initially assigned to the PPR family
                                 (Tables S2 and S5) were characterized in terms of their encoded PPR domain structures.
                                 Eight DEGs (DEG1, DEG2, DEG4–DEG7, DEG9, and DEG11) were predicted to encode
                                 P-class PPR proteins belonging to the RFL subclade. The remaining DEGs (DEG3, DEG8,
                                 DEG10, and DEG12–DEG14) encoded proteins with 15–20 P-sites.
                                       On the basis of their encoded PPR domains, 7 PAGs (PAG1, PAG5, PAG10, PAG16,
                                 PAG25, PAG32, and PAG52) were classified in the RFL subclass, whereas another
                                 20 PAGs (PAG8, PAG9, PAG11, PAG13, PAG15, PAG18, PAG19, PAG22, PAG27, PAG33–
                                 PAG38, PAG42, PAG43, PAG45, PAG47, and PAG48) were assigned to the P-class, but they
                                 contained fewer than 15 tandem repeats. The remaining 21 PAGs (PAG2–PAG4, PAG6,
                                 PAG12, PAG14, PAG17, PAG20, PAG21, PAG23, PAG24, PAG26, PAG28–PAG31, PAG39,
                                 PAG40, PAG46, PAG49, and PAG51) belonged to the PLS-class.

                                   3. Discussion
                                         Modern plant cultivars are expected to have high-value agronomic and nutritional
                                   properties. Moreover, protecting the intellectual property rights of cultivar breeders is
                                   becoming an increasingly important issue. Therefore, the breeding of hybrid cultivars is
                                   warranted because such cultivars are usually associated with increased yield and quality.
                                   They also protect the interests of breeders because growers must purchase the F1 seeds
                                   from licensed distributors every time, owing to an inability of the growers to reproduce the
                                   seeds themselves. The seeds of all currently registered wheat F1 cultivars were produced ac-
                                   cording to relatively efficient and uncomplicated methods involving CHAs. Unfortunately,
                                   in some European countries, including Poland, the application of CHAs for hybrid seed
                                   production is forbidden. Furthermore, the disadvantages of using CHAs include the need
                                   for dosage optimization, relatively high costs, the poor performance of CHA-based hybrids,
                                   and poor seed germination [10,14]. Accordingly, wheat hybrid breeding methods that
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                          14 of 25
                                 exploit natural mechanisms, especially those related to sterilizing cytoplasm and Rf genes,
                                 must be developed. Major limitations of such methods, however, are the complexity of the
                                 fertility restoration process mediated by nine Rf genes, of which two or three major restorer
                                 loci are required to fully restore fertility and the extremely low frequency of dominant
                                 Rf alleles.
                                        In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize wheat Rf genes by performing a
                                 transcriptome analysis followed by untargeted and targeted analyses of the generated data.
                                 Over the past decade, RNA-seq has become indispensable for transcriptome-wide analyses
                                 of DEGs [63]. Several studies have used RNA-seq to identify candidate genes and QTLs
                                 controlling specific traits and processes in wheat [64–68]. However, the utility of RNA-seq
                                 for identifying Rf genes has not been explored. Moreover, RNA-seq is demanding in terms
                                 of sequencing data coverage and computational analysis, but it generates gene expression
                                 data that can be further compared in different combinations. Because of its sufficient
                                 sensitivity and sequencing depth, RNA-seq is more suitable and affordable for comparative
                                 gene expression studies than microarrays, and it generates more data, including for genes
                                 that are expressed at low levels [69,70].
                                        For the transcriptome analyses in the current study, RNA was extracted from anthers
                                 at the T and M developmental stages. These stages were selected on the basis of numerous
                                 preliminary experiments as well as literature searches. Ye et al. [71], looking for molecular
                                 mechanisms responsible for male sterility/fertility conversion in wheat with Ae. kotschyi
                                 thermosensitive cytoplasmic male sterility selected three anther developmental stages
                                 (i.e., late uninucleate, binucleate, and trinucleate) for their RNA-seq analysis. Comparing
                                 anther development under sterile and fertile conditions, they detected the most signifi-
                                 cant differences at the late uninucleate stage. Additionally, most genes related to male
                                 sterility/fertility conversion were differentially expressed at the late uninucleate stage,
                                 which is one of the stages we analyzed. Ye et al. [71] did not investigate the tetrad stage
                                 (i.e., the T stage in our study) because they did not detect any obvious differences in anther
                                 development between sterile and fertile conditions. However, one should consider the
                                 essential differences between both systems of sterility and, consequently, the differences
                                 in the expression of genes mediating fertility restoration. Furthermore, the mitochondrial
                                 gene orf279, which is important for the cms trait [47], is highly expressed in the early
                                 anthesis stage. Its transcript, which is targeted by the proteins encoded by at least two
                                 Rf genes (Rf1 and Rf3), is also produced at a relatively early microsporogenesis stage.
                                 Thus, searching for Rf candidate genes at this stage makes sense. Earlier studies on the
                                 fertility restoration genes of other cereal species, namely Rf2 and Rf4 in rice and Rf4 in
                                 maize, revealed that these genes are overexpressed during meiosis and in the uninucleate
                                 microspore (and in binucleate and trinucleate microspores in rice) pollen developmental
                                 stages [13,23,72].
                                        The RNA-seq analysis of 24 libraries in this study detected 20,368 DEGs (among
                                 860.5 million high-quality reads). The efficiency of this transcriptome sequencing analysis
                                 was higher than that of earlier studies, including a study by Xiao et al. [73] that determined
                                 the transcriptional changes in the roots of low-cadmium-accumulating winter wheat under
                                 cadmium stress, a study by Xiong et al. [74], who used RNA-seq to search for candidate
                                 genes associated with salinity tolerance, and a study by Iquebal et al. [66], who identified
                                 drought-responsive molecular pathways in wheat roots by analyzing the transcriptome.
                                        To precisely filter candidate Rf genes from such a large number of reads, a multi-stage
                                 selection procedure was applied. Finally, 21 DEGs were designated as candidate fertility
                                 restorer genes to be further analyzed. The selected DEGs were at least 50% similar to one
                                 or more sequences in a local database comprising the sequences of all known Rf, PPR
                                 domain-encoding, and ADD-encoding genes in the Poaceae species. Their potential role
                                 as fertility restorers was verified following a BLAST analysis using known Rf genes as
                                 queries. Two-thirds of these DEGs matched PPR domain-encoding genes, whereas the
                                 remaining DEGs matched the maize ZmRf2 (Rf2a) gene, which encodes the ADD. The
                                 genes involved in restoring the fertility of wheat containing the T. timopheevii sterilizing
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                            15 of 25
                                 cytoplasm that have been described to date encode regulatory proteins (e.g., RNA splicing
                                 factors) belonging to the P-class PPR family. These proteins stabilize organellar transcripts
                                 and intron splicing [75–77]. A recent study by Melonek et al. [47] proved that two PPR
                                 proteins (encoded by Rf1 and Rf3) target the mitochondrial orf279 transcript. The binding of
                                 these two proteins to this transcript leads to cleavage and prevents the expression of the cms
                                 trait. The maize Rf2a gene is considered to be the only Rf gene encoding a mitochondrial
                                 aldehyde dehydrogenase that restores male fertility to plants with CMS-T [78]. However,
                                 the results of our current study suggest that at least some wheat Rf candidate genes can
                                 encode proteins with the ADD. The target of the protein encoded by the maize Rf2 gene in
                                 this class remains unknown, but RF2A most likely oxidizes a broad range of aldehydes [67].
                                       The in silico expression profiles for most of the selected DEGs were as expected (i.e., they
                                 were overexpressed in at least one restorer cultivar and in at least one developmental stage),
                                 especially the DEGs encoding the PPR domain in Patras. Surprisingly, only four DEGs (DEG9
                                 and DEG14 belonging to the PPR family and DEG19 and DEG20 encoding the ADD) were
                                 overexpressed in Primépi, which is considered to be an Rf gene donor.
                                       To increase the pool of Rf candidate genes, 21 DEGs were subjected to a PAG analysis,
                                 which resulted in the identification of 775 PAGs in 19 clusters. However, only one cluster
                                 (M8) comprised PAGs that were differentially expressed between the fertility-restoring
                                 cultivars and the non-fertility-restoring cultivars in the M and T stages. Clusters M9,
                                 M17, and M18 comprised PAGs that were either restorer cultivar-specific (M9 and M17)
                                 or developmental stage-specific (M18). The PAGs in the remaining 15 clusters were un-
                                 likely to be fertility restorer genes. This supplementary, highly effective analysis revealed
                                 51 new Rf candidate genes, most of which belonged to the P-class PPR family, implying
                                 they encode RNA splicing factors.
                                       A bioinformatics analysis of the promoters of the DEGs, PAGs, and 12 reference genes
                                 enabled the identification of dozens of cre. Substantial similarities were observed between
                                 the DEG, PAG, and reference gene promoters, both in terms of cre frequency and type.
                                 Notably, among the most frequent cre that were present in almost all reference gene, DEG,
                                 and PAG promoters, ABRE, the CGTCA-motif, and the TGACG-motif are associated with
                                 signal transduction pathways involved in stress responses. Chen et al. [79] (2018) detected
                                 ABRE and the TGACG motif in a 1.5-kb sequence upstream of 491 rice PPR-encoding genes.
                                 The ABRE identified by Chen et al. [79] was also detected in the gene promoters analyzed
                                 in this study, albeit at a slightly lower frequency. These findings support the hypothesis
                                 formulated by Chen et al. [79] that the genes belonging to the PPR family are responsive
                                 to stress. We propose that DEGs encoding the ADD are also related to stress responses
                                 because of the relatively high frequency of these three cre in their promoters. Individual
                                 MYB-related cre were present in the analyzed gene promoters at a slightly lower frequency
                                 than some of the other cre. However, when they were combined into one group, the MYB
                                 cre frequency was very high (i.e., 8.05, 7.77, and 5.75 per 100 nt for the DEGs, PAGs, and
                                 reference genes, respectively). The MYB transcription factors regulate pollen development
                                 mainly by modulating the expression of downstream target genes that control tapetum
                                 development, programmed cell death, uninucleate microspore differentiation, pollen spore
                                 pigment synthesis, mature pollen functions, anther dehiscence, and angiosperm pollen
                                 development [80]. The diversity in the effects of these transcription factors may help to
                                 explain the high frequency of these cre.
                                       Along with the availability of a wheat reference genome [81], molecular markers
                                 developed for decades by wheat researchers can now be physically mapped and compared
                                 with the positions of candidate DEGs or PAGs with defined expression patterns. To date,
                                 several types of molecular markers, including restriction fragment length polymorphism
                                 (RFLP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), SNP, kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), and
                                 diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers, have been linked to the following seven
                                 Rf genes: Rf1 [46,47,82], Rf2 [50], Rf3 [39–42,47,49,82,83], Rf4 [41], Rf6 [35], Rf8 [36], and
                                 Rf9 [39]. The DNA sequences of all available genetic markers flanking the genes and QTLs
                                 related to fertility restoration were used to delimit target regions. The Rf1, Rf4, Rf8, and
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                       16 of 25
                                 Rf9 physical regions have been consistently reported [36,39,41,46,49–52]. The number of
                                 candidate genes encoding proteins with PPR domains was determined by URGI. The
                                 Rf8 region on 2D (13.7–23.2 Mb) lacks PPR-encoding genes in the CS reference genome
                                 (Table S3).
                                       Only one anchor marker has been identified for Rf2 [50]. Additionally, analyses of Rf6
                                 have produced inconsistent findings. In one earlier study involving RFLP markers, Rf6
                                 was mapped to the 371.5–445.1 cM region on 5D that includes eight PPR genes annotated
                                 in the CS reference genome [41]. In contrast, SSR markers for Rf6 translocated with the
                                 6U segment from Ae. umbellulata to chromosome 6A [84]. A BLAST analysis indicated Rf6
                                 was localized in the 413.0–437.5 Mb region on 6B, which includes a single annotated PPR
                                 gene. The Rf3 gene has been extensively investigated. We detected the following three
                                 regions on 1B that may affect fertility restoration: 16.8–44.07 Mb (Rf3 explaining 7%–21%
                                 of the phenotypic variation), 336.3–363.1 Mb (QRf.Sv-1B), and 506.3–557.1 Mb (explaining
                                 16.8%–38.2% of the phenotypic variation) (Table S3).
                                       Identifying the DEGs and PAGs in physical regions previously confirmed to contain
                                 fertility-restoring genes is the most straightforward way to select Rf candidate genes. This
                                 approach successfully detected Rf1 and Rf3 candidate genes. We determined that the Rf1
                                 region on 1A refers to the 5.0–28.6 Mbp fragment [39]. The SNP marker AX-94682405
                                 positioned at 14.1 Mb is closely linked to Rf1 [46]. The physical positions corresponding to
                                 SNP markers (cfn0522096 and cfn0527067) and Rf1 were more precisely determined in a
                                 recent study by Melonek et al. [47]. Three PPR genes (TaPPR1–3) were annotated in this
                                 region, one of which was localized to the same position (14.8 Mbp) as DEG1 (RFL79). In
                                 our study, DEG1 expression was lower in Patras than in Astoria and Grana in the M stage,
                                 whereas the other PPR genes in this region were not differentially expressed.
                                       The mining of the available mapping results for fertility-restoring genes on chro-
                                 mosome 1B generated interesting results. Regarding the mapping of Rf3, three physical
                                 locations on chromosome 1B affecting fertility restoration were identified. The Rf3 gene
                                 has been most frequently mapped in the 16.8–44.1 Mbp region [39,40,46,49]. However, two
                                 additional loci in the 336.2–363.3 Mbp region [49] corresponding to QRf.Sv-1B and in the
                                 506.3–557.1 Mbp region have also been reported [49,50]. Ten PPR genes (TaPPR89–98) were
                                 annotated in the main region of Rf3, localized on 1BS, and four DEGs (DEG3, DEG4, DEG5,
                                 and DEG6) were mapped in the main locus (18.0–18.8 Mbp). The expression patterns
                                 of these DEGs varied, but the expression levels of all four DEGs were lower in Primépi
                                 than in Astoria in the T stage. Recent data confirmed that DEG5 (RFL29b) corresponds
                                 to Rf3 [47]. Both DEG3 (RFL164) and DEG4 (RFL396) produced truncated transcripts
                                 and DEG6 (RFL58) was not rejected. Interestingly, none of the DEGs or PAGs mapped to
                                 chromosome 1BS were overexpressed in Primépi, which is a known Rf3 donor [31,40,43].
                                 Instead, DEG4 was overexpressed (in both assays) in the fertility-restorer cultivar Patras,
                                 which may be considered as a source of Rf genes, including known (Rf3) and unknown
                                 genes located on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6B, 7A, and 7D.
                                       Two additional fertility-restoring loci were identified on chromosome 1B. The QRf.Sv-
                                 1B locus, which was responsible for 13.9%–17.6% of the seed set variation, was delimited
                                 to the 336.21–363.15 Mb region. Three PPR genes, including PAG34, were mapped in this
                                 region. Five PPR genes and one gene encoding a protein with the ADD were mapped
                                 (506.33–557.12 Mb) in the second main fertility restoration locus on 1B, which was also
                                 reported as Rf3 [49,50], but no functional markers matched this region.
                                       Two PAGs (PAG17 and PAG16) that were more highly expressed in Patras than in both
                                 non-fertility-restoring cultivars in the M and T stages were mapped in the CS reference
                                 genome in regions corresponding to Rf4 and Rf9. The Rf4 region spans a 28-Mb fragment
                                 on the short arm of chromosome 6B and contains a cluster of 11 PPR genes, including
                                 PAG17, which may be a functional Rf4 candidate gene. Similarly, Rf9 was delimited to the
                                 1–23.7 Mb region on 6A, in which 11 PPR genes were mapped, including PAG16.
                                       In the present study, 11 DEGs were mapped on the chromosomes of homoeologous
                                 groups 1 and 6, including five DEGs located in regions corresponding to Rf1 and Rf3.

                                 The positions of the remaining DEGs on chromosomes of homoeologous groups 2 and
                                 7 were not within known Rf loci [39,49,51]. Four DEGs (DEG8–DEG11) assigned to a
                                 wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosome belong to the PPR family, and the remaining six
                                 DEGs (DEG16–DEG21) on chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D are members of the ADD family
                                 (Table S3).
                                       A total of 11 DEGs and 11 PAGs were selected for a qRT-PCR assay to validate
                                 the results of the RNA-seq and PAG analyses. The qRT-PCR assay has been broadly
                                 used to validate the results of transcriptome-based investigations (e.g., RNA-seq) and is
                                 considered to be an independent and highly sensitive tool for targeted analyses. However,
                                 an advantage of RNA-seq is that it does not require preliminary knowledge or assumptions
                                 about the genes of interest. Thus, it has been successfully used in transcriptomic studies
                                 (e.g., [85–87]). In some cases, RNA-seq has been applied to validate data [88,89]. Recently,
                                 Garriado et al. [90] used qRT-PCR to validate RNA-seq data in their study aimed at
                                 identifying wheat reference genes related to meiosis.
                                       Among the genes identified in this study, 10 DEGs and 10 PAGs were chosen because
                                 their RNA-seq expression profiles were as expected (i.e., expression level that was higher
                                 in at least one fertility-restorer than in at least one non-restorer in at least one anther
                                 developmental stage). Both DEG6 and PAG34 were selected because their expression
                                 profiles were inconsistent with what was expected (i.e., higher expression level in Asto-
                                 ria than in the fertility-restoring cultivars in the T stage or in both the T and M stages).
                                 Furthermore, all DEGs and PAGs included in the qRT-PCR assay encoded the PPR do-
                                 main, which is the most typical domain encoded by Rf genes. Unexpectedly, only some
                                 of the DEGs and PAGs had expression profiles that were consistent between the two
                                 applied approaches.
                                       The DEG expression data were highly consistent between the in silico and qRT-PCR
                                 analyses, whereas relatively consistent expression profiles were obtained for only three
                                 PAGs. These results may be related to the specificity and degree of accuracy of both
                                 methods. The discrepancies between the gene expression levels determined by RNA-
                                 seq and qRT-PCR may also be due to the sequence selected for designing primers (i.e.,
                                 insufficient specificity). Another possible explanation for the differences between the RNA-
                                 seq and qRT-PCR expression patterns involves how extensively the gene families were
                                 investigated. Furthermore, alleles may differ regarding their expression levels. There were
                                 more than 1000 possible sequences for designing primers for each DEG. In this study, we
                                 used universal primers for some DEGs, whereas primers specific to the fertility-restorers
                                 were used for other DEGs. In some cases, both primer types were used. The high allelic
                                 variation reported for candidate fertility restoration genes leads to variable templates and
                                 hinders the designing of gene-specific primers.
                                       The most surprising result was the differential expression of DEG9 and DEG14 in
                                 the fertility-restoring cultivars, depending on the analytical method. More specifically,
                                 the RNA-seq analysis indicated these genes were overexpressed in Primépi, but the qRT-
                                 PCR data suggested both genes were overexpressed in Patras. A similar discrepancy in
                                 expression levels was observed for PAG22 and PAG27. These four genes will need to be
                                 investigated more thoroughly in future studies.
                                       A total of 14 DEGs and 48 PAGs initially determined to encode the PPR domain were
                                 subjected to a deeper structural analysis, which revealed that only eight DEGs and seven
                                 PAGs fully satisfied the criteria for identifying genes encoding P-class RFL proteins. Both
                                 DEG8 and PAG15 encoded PPR motifs consisting of 14 P-sites (i.e., only one fewer than the
                                 generally recognized lower limit). Interestingly, among the RFL-encoding DEGs, DEG1
                                 and DEG2 did not produce the expected expression profiles. A similar result was obtained
                                 for PAG5 (i.e., the expression level was lower in the fertility-restoring cultivars than in the
                                 non-fertility-restoring cultivars) and for PAG16 (i.e., the expression profile was not verified
                                 by qRT-PCR). Moreover, DEG10, DEG12, and PAG27, which were overexpressed in Patras
                                 in both analyses, are not functional Rf genes because they encode fewer than 15 P motifs.
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                                              18 of 25
                                             Twenty-one of the PAGs were designated as genes encoding PLS-class proteins, which
                                       are strongly associated with RNA editing (i.e., the post-transcriptional alteration of RNA se-
                                       quences) [91]. Surprisingly, one of the PLS-encoding PAGs, namely PAG31, was apparently
                                       overexpressed in the fertility-restoring cultivar, Patras.
                                             On the basis of our study results, we speculate that seven genes (three DEGs and four
                                       PAGs) are Rf candidate genes (Table 3). These candidates meet the following criteria: an
                                       expected expression pattern (i.e., significantly higher expression level in one or both fertility
                                       restorers than in both non-restorers in at least one developmental stage); an expression
                                       pattern that was validated by qRT-PCR; the presence of all or most cre; and the inclusion of
                                       a sequence encoding the PPR domain, indicative of a function related to fertility restoration.
                                       In addition to the identification of DEG4 as an Rf3 candidate gene, six other genes were
                                       proposed as candidates for major restorer genes. All selected candidates belong to the
                                       PPR family. This set did not include DEG1 mapped in the Rf1 region or PAG16 and
                                       PAG17 mapped in the Rf9 and Rf4 regions, respectively, because their expression profiles
                                       in both assays were the opposite to what was expected. Together with the genes that were
                                       excluded on the basis of the “wet” expressional analysis, the above-mentioned DEGs and
                                       PAGs will need to be investigated further using new, redesigned primers. Among the
                                       candidate genes, only DEG4 is precisely located in the previously determined position
                                       for Rf3 [39–42,49,50,82,83]. Surprisingly, DEG4 was clearly overexpressed in Patras and
                                       not in Primépi, which is an Rf3 donor [31,40,43]. The remaining two DEGs and all PAGs
                                       were mapped in entirely new positions. Moreover, PAG52 was assigned to chromosome
                                       7B, where neither Rf nor Rf -related QTLs have been mapped to date. However, no DEGs
                                       or PAGs were mapped in the previously determined positions on chromosomes 2DS (with
                                       Rf8), 6D (with Rf5), and 7D (with Rf2). It is likely that neither of the two fertility-restoring
                                       cultivars included in this study is a source of Rf2, Rf5, or Rf8.

                                 cultivar, a source of the Rf3 gene, pedigree: selected from Superhatif, Yeoman//Barbu-
                                 D-Ukraine/Bon-Fermier). Patras can effectively restore the fertility of two cultivars with
                                 T. timopheevii cytoplasm (Chriscms and Selkrikcms ) (Professor A. J. Lukaszewski, personal
                                 communication). Additionally, its fertility-restoring properties were determined on the
                                 basis of field experiments performed over several years by researchers in the Department
                                 of Plant Genetics, Breeding and Biotechnology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences.
                                        Plants, after undergoing a 6-week vernalization at 4 ◦ C, were transferred to a growth
                                 chamber (ForClean, ZalMed Sp. z.o.o, Warsaw, Poland) and incubated under the following
                                 conditions: 14-h light (18 ◦ C)/10-h dark (15 ◦ C) and 50% relative humidity. Plants were
                                 cultivated in pots (19 cm diameter) containing a mixture of peat and perlite (1:1, v/v),
                                 with three plants per pot. The plants were hand irrigated daily to ensure the soil water
                                 content was close to field capacity. After ear emergence was considered to be complete
                                 (i.e., 59 on the Zadoks growth scale), anthers were harvested from spikes at the tetrad
                                 (T) and late uninucleate microspore (M) stages. The experimentally determined auricle
                                 distance (AD) was used for predicting the anther developmental stage in all four vari-
                                 eties (Table S7). The RNA-seq analysis was completed using three biological replicates,
                                 each comprising 70–80 anthers. The collected anthers were immediately submerged in
                                 RNAlater™ Stabilization Solution (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
                                 and then stored at −80 ◦ C.
                                 4.2. RNA Isolation
                                        Total RNA was extracted from the frozen anthers using the GeneMATRIX Universal
                                 RNA Purification Kit (EURx, Gdańsk, Poland). The quantity and purity of each RNA
                                 sample were determined according to the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, which was
                                 measured using the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer and the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer
                                 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA integrity number for the total RNA was
                                 determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer and the Plant RNA Pico or RNA 6000 Nano Kit
                                 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA was also examined by 1% agarose
                                 gel electrophoresis.
                                 4.3. RNA-Seq Analysis
                                        The total RNA extracted from the harvested anthers was subjected to a poly(A) enrich-
                                 ment step using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Bi-
                                 olabs,     Ipswich,     MA, USA). Twenty-four strand-specific cDNA libraries
                                 (i.e., three biological replicates of the four cultivars at two anther developmental stages)
                                 were constructed using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for
                                 Illumina® (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were sequenced using
                                 the HiSeq 4000 system (Illumina) in the PE150 mode, and the data were analyzed by
                                 Genomed S.A.
                                        Regarding the data analysis, the Cutadapt program was used in the paired-end mode
                                 to remove adapters (only from the 30 side) and polyA sequences (and analogously generated
                                 tails with the polyT sequence). Short reads (<36 bp) were also eliminated. The retained
                                 clean reads were mapped to the T. aestivum reference genome (GenBank accession no.
                                 GCA_900519105.1, NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA) using TopHat [92]. More specifically, the
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                         20 of 25
                                 TopHat options appropriate for the fr-firststrand library were used in the no-novel-juncs
                                 mode. Next, the number of reads mapped to individual genes was calculated using the
                                 HTseq program [93] (Anders et al., 2014), with transcript strand differentiation (–stranded
                                 = reverse). The mapping data were processed in the R environment using the DESeq2
                                 package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) according to the following criteria:
                                 threshold false discovery rate of 0.05 and an absolute log2 (fold-change) ≥0.5. The DEGs
                                 were identified by comparing the non-restorers and restorers individually and in pairs
                                 at the T and M stages. Sequencing data were deposited in the ArrayExpress database via
                                 Annotare (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress accessed on 16 August 2021).
                                       The DEGs were functionally characterized on the basis of gene ontology (GO) terms,
                                 which were assigned using the biomaRt and topGO package [94]. A Venn diagram was
                                 constructed using the jvenn tool [95]. Amino acid sequences encoded by the Rf genes from
                                 Poaceae species and the consensus PPR motif retrieved from the NCBI database and from a
                                 published article [96] were incorporated into a local database and used for selecting DEGs
                                 (Table S1). The DEGs related to the sequences in the local database were filtered out in the
                                 R environment using the BLAST program. To identify potential cis-regulatory elements
                                 (cre) in the promotor sequences of the selected DEGs and reference genes, the sequences
                                 2000 bp upstream of the genes were screened using PlantCare [97].
                                 4.4. Paralog Analysis
                                       The Ensembl Plants database (http://plants.ensembl.org/ accessed on 16 August
                                 2021) was used to search for the PAGs of 21 selected DEGs. The PAGs with a mean
                                 expression level (i.e., mean number of mapped reads) in the samples exceeding 10 were
                                 clustered according to an unsigned weighted correlation network analysis in the R package
                                 WGCNA, with the following parameters: beta = 1; clustering method “complete”; cutting
                                 method “cutreeStaticColor”; cutHeight = 0.40; minSize = 10 [98,99].
                                 4.5. Mapping DEGs and PAGs in Rf Linkage Groups
                                       On the basis of structural comparisons, the DEGs and PAGs were mapped to previ-
                                 ously reported chromosomal segments containing fertility-restoring genes. Markers linked
                                 to the fertility restoration genes Rf1–Rf4, Rf6, Rf8, and Rf9 along with QTLs were retrieved
                                 from published reports [36,39–41,46,47,50,52]. Next, the DNA sequences of the respective
                                 RFLP probes, SSR markers (or primers), and SNP markers were retrieved from CerealsDB
                                 (https://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/indexNEW.php accessed on
                                 16 August 2021) or GrainGenes (https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG3/ accessed on 16 August
                                 2021). The sequences served as queries for a BLAST search of the Chinese Spring (CS) wheat
                                 genome assembly (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0) by URGI (https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/blast/
                                 accessed on 16 August 2021). The best hits for the target chromosomal regions were selected
                                 to call marker physical positions. Similarly, the positions of all DEGs selected in this study
                                 on the reference map were determined. Additionally, the positions of all PPR genes in the
                                 target regions were determined by URGI and added to the partial physical maps of the
                                 chromosomal segments with mapped fertility-restoring genes.
                                 4.6. Validation of Transcripts by RT-qPCR Analysis
                                       The relative expression levels of genes selected according to the RNA-seq and PAG
                                 analyses were validated by qRT-PCR (Table S2). Total RNA (500 ng) served as the template
                                 for synthesizing the first-strand cDNA using the smART First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
                                 (EurX) and an oligo(dT)20 primer. The qRT-PCR assay was performed using a 48-well plate
                                 and the Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The 10-µL qRT-PCR
                                 mixture included 2 µL cDNA, 500 nM of each gene-specific primer, and 5 µL 2× GoTaq
                                 qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed
                                 using three biological replicates and two technical replicates. The PCR program was as
                                 follows: 95 ◦ C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95 ◦ C for 15 s, and 60 ◦ C for 60 s. The gene-specific
                                 primers were designed according to the cDNA sequence fragments conserved across Grana,
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9146                                                                                                       21 of 25
                                       Astoria, Patras, and Primépi (universal) or the sequence fragments useful for distinguishing
                                       between fertility-restoring and non-fertility-restoring cultivars, which were determined
                                       from the RNA-seq clean reads (Table S2). The HvAct (GenBank accession no. AY145451)
                                       and cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD)-like (GenBank accession no. AK453202.1) genes [90]
                                       were used as internal reference controls. The expression levels of the analyzed genes
                                       were normalized against the internal reference gene expression levels using the 2−∆∆Ct
                                       method [100]. The significance of the differences between ∆Ct values was assessed by the
                                       Mann–Whitney U test (with continuity correction) in the STATISTICA 12 package (TIBCO
                                       Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
                                       4.7. Annotation of PPR Genes
                                              The PPR domains of the selected DEGs and PAGs (Tables S2 and S5) were annotated
                                       by Plant Energy Biology [91]. The restorer-of-fertility-like (RFL) proteins among the P-class
                                       PPR subfamily members were selected on the basis of the presence of tandem arrays
                                       comprising 15–20 PPR motifs, each composed of 35 amino acid residues [47].
