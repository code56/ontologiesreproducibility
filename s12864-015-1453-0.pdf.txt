Pistillody mutant reveals key insights into stamen
and pistil development in wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.)

  Abstract
  Background: The pistillody mutant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plant HTS-1 exhibits homeotic transformation of
  stamens into pistils or pistil-like structures. Unlike common wheat varieties, HTS-1 produces three to six pistils per
  floret, potentially increasing the yield. Thus, HTS-1 is highly valuable in the study of floral development in wheat. In
  this study, we conducted RNA sequencing of the transcriptomes of the pistillody stamen (PS) and the pistil (P) from
  HTS-1 plants, and the stamen (S) from the non-pistillody control variety Chinese Spring TP to gain insights into pistil
  and stamen development in wheat.
  Results: Approximately 40 Gb of processed reads were obtained from PS, P, and S. De novo assembly yielded
  121,210 putative unigenes, with a mean length of 695 bp. Among these high-quality unigenes, 59,199 (48.84%) had
  at least one significant match with an existing gene model. A total of 23, 263, and 553 differentially expressed genes
  were identified in PS vs. P, PS vs. S, and P vs. S, respectively, with differences in expression greater than five-fold.
  Among the differentially expressed genes, 206 were highly correlated with stamen and pistil development. These
  genes include WM27B, DL, YAB1, YABBY4, WM 5, CER 1, and WBLH1, which have been implicated in flower development.
  The expression patterns of 25 differentially expressed genes were confirmed through quantitative real-time
  reverse transcription PCR.
  Conclusions: Analysis of this transcriptome resource enabled us to characterize gene expression profiles, examine
  differential gene expression, and produce a candidate gene list related to wheat stamen and pistil development. This
  work is significant for the development of genomic resources for wheat, and provides important insights into the
  molecular mechanisms of wheat stamen and pistil development.
