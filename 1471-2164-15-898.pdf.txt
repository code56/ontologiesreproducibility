  Abstract
  Background: Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici;
  Bgt) are important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Similar mechanisms and gene transcripts are
  assumed to be involved in the host defense response because both pathogens are biotrophic fungi. The main
  objective of our study was to identify co-regulated mRNAs that show a change in expression pattern after inoculation
  with Pst or Bgt, and to identify mRNAs specific to the fungal stress response.
  Results: The transcriptome of the hexaploid wheat line N9134 inoculated with the Chinese Pst race CYR 31 was
  compared with that of the same line inoculated with Bgt race E09 at 1, 2, and 3 days post-inoculation. Infection by
  Pst and Bgt affected transcription of 23.8% of all T. aestivum genes. Infection by Bgt triggered a more robust alteration
  in gene expression in N9134 compared with the response to Pst infection. An array of overlapping gene clusters with
  distinctive expression patterns provided insight into the regulatory differences in the responses to Bgt and Pst infection.
  The differentially expressed genes were grouped into seven enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  pathways in Bgt-infected leaves and four pathways in Pst-infected leaves, while only two pathways overlapped. In the
  plant–pathogen interaction pathway, N9134 activated a higher number of genes and pathways in response to Bgt
  infection than in response to Pst invasion. Genomic analysis revealed that the wheat genome shared some microbial
  genetic fragments, which were specifically induced in response to Bgt and Pst infection.
  Conclusions: Taken together, our findings indicate that the responses of wheat N9134 to infection by Bgt and Pst
  shows differences in the pathways and genes activated. The mass sequence data for wheat–fungus interaction
  generated in this study provides a powerful platform for future functional and molecular research on wheat–fungus
  interactions.
