Please note that since creating this repository, EBI depricated XML files and is only using JSON files. More information on this 
is found on https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/help#programmatic

Therefore, the code that was programmatically fetching XML files given the ArrayExpress number, doesn't work. However if
you go to previous commits of this code, namely on August 24th 2022, you will find all of the code outputs including the
XML files corresponding to the ArrayExpress codes found in the various use-case papers.

Moreover, on the same commit (August 24th 2022) you can see the scores.csv file that shows all
the computations done by the code. 

Should you wish to work or expand this code with adjustments for the code to be using JSON files
instead of the XML files feel free to do so.
