  Abstract
  Background: Next-generation sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to identify the genetic
  components responsible for trait variation. However, in species with large polyploid genomes, such as bread
  wheat, the ability to rapidly identify genes underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) remains non-trivial. To overcome
  this, we introduce a novel pipeline that analyses, by RNA-sequencing, multiple near-isogenic lines segregating for
  a targeted QTL.
  Results: We use this approach to characterize a major and widely utilized seed dormancy QTL located on chromosome
  4AL. It exploits the power and mapping resolution afforded by large multi-parent mapping populations, whilst reducing
  complexity by using multi-allelic contrasts at the targeted QTL region. Our approach identifies two adjacent candidate
  genes within the QTL region belonging to the ABA-induced Wheat Plasma Membrane 19 family. One of them, PM19-A1,
  is highly expressed during grain maturation in dormant genotypes. The second, PM19-A2, shows changes in sequence
  causing several amino acid alterations between dormant and non-dormant genotypes. We confirm that PM19
  genes are positive regulators of seed dormancy.
  Conclusions: The efficient identification of these strong candidates demonstrates the utility of our transcriptomic
  pipeline for rapid QTL to gene mapping. By using this approach we are able to provide a comprehensive genetic
  analysis of the major source of grain dormancy in wheat. Further analysis across a diverse panel of bread and
  durum wheats indicates that this important dormancy QTL predates hexaploid wheat. The use of these genes by
  wheat breeders could assist in the elimination of pre-harvest sprouting in wheat.
